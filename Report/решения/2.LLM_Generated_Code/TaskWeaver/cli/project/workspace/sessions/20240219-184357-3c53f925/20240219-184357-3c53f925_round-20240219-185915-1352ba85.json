The predictors have been ordered based on their importance, with 'hardware' and 'osName' being the most informative features. This revised approach provides a more accurate understanding of the features that are most relevant for predicting the 'fclick' event. The mutual information values serve as evidence of the relevance of each feature. If further validation or model training is required, please provide additional instructions.",
